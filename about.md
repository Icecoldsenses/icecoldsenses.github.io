Hi, I'm Ayushi Shukla a researcher with Master's in Biotechnology, a curious reader, a wanderer, a thinker, and sometimes, a painter. This blog is a reflection of everything I explore and feel, from books and films to inner thoughts and memories of places I’ve been.

Here, you’ll find posts under:
- 📚 **Reading**: reviews and reflections on books
- 🎥 **Watching**: thoughts on films and videos
- ✈️ **Travelling**: personal travel stories
- 🎨 **Painting**: images + 100-word thoughts
- 💭 **Thinking**: raw and real ideas

This is my corner of the internet. You’re welcome here.
